			<h3 class="p-1">Why should I book with Quincy’s Discount Travel?
			</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="container" >
			<p >Quincy Discount Travel is proud to have served the Quincy community for over 30 years. In the office we have over 40 years of travel advisor experience. We are honored to be a top-tier travel agency in the community - but why book with a travel agent? Less work for you! We are happy to get our hands dirty and allow you to relax both before and during your vacation. We are here to serve you, and are happy to sit with you face-to-face or connect with you by phone - in most cases with no hold time! A common misconception is that travel agents charge fees on fees on fees. However, the only time we charge fees is when someone only books an airline ticket. Otherwise, we are paid by our supplier by what is already in the package price!

			<h3 class="p-1">What is required to travel?
			</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="container" >
			<p>A passport! Passports are required for any trip outside of the U.S. (not including Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands). If you are headed to an all-inclusive destination a passport will be required. Any trips within the U.S. will require a legal form of identification, which may include a U.S. driver's license. Other countries may require other documents like a customs form or travel Visa. In order to find these country specific requirements, we encourage clients to visit

			<h3 class="p-1">When should I book my trip?
			</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="container" >
			<p>We suggest trips be booked at least six months prior to departure! There is typically last minute availability; however, it might not be your ideal vacation or price point. We suggest giving yourself plenty of time to guarantee the best price. It will also ensure that there are plenty of available rooms at resorts/hotels and seats on the flight. Air is often available within nine months of departure.

			<h3 class="p-1">How do I pay for my trip?
			</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="container" >
			<p>In most cases outside of 45 days from departure a deposit will be required to lock in your spot and the given total price. The final payment date will be set between 50 days for all-inclusive destination or 75-120 days before cruises and other guided tours. No payment plan is required, and we can put in payments anytime they are requested! Once final payment time rolls around we will need the remaining balance paid so your trip does not cancel out!

			<h3 class="p-1">Do I need Travel Insurace?
			</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="container" >
			<p>Travel insurance is highly encouraged! In the past few years we have seen Maui wildfires, hurricanes off the coast, and of course a pandemic. All of these unforeseen events lead to trip delays and cancellations. Luckily, many of our clients had travel protection to re-coop any losses and process refunds. Many of our all-inclusive or air and hotel packages offer a cancel for any reason protection. Travel protection often covers sickness, injury or death of a loved one; quarantine; jury duty/sub poena; financial default. They may also include coverage for trip delay, missed connection, lost or delayed baggage, medical, dental, and evacuation.
